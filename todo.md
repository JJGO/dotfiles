TODO
====

- VIM with Monokai colors
- Remove the stow dependency - Maybe with dotbot? Stow is oftentimes not installed and it's kinda annoying having to install it without sudo
- Yabai focus follows mouse is kinda annoying for stuff like iStat Menus. I think I have a correct rule but the release is still not there yet 2020-11-25 (https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/675) - Check this in the future.
