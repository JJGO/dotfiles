- VIM with Monokai colors
- zsh package manager - https://old.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/jph7eg/package_mangers_for_zsh/? Anish does git submodules
  - If stick with prezto, way to auto-update  by pulling
- zsh for humans? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romkatv/zsh4humans/v4/install. From the creator of powerlevel10k, seems like a good set of defaults to replace prezto - https://old.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/f5ak4d/rfc_zsh_for_humans/
- zsh autocomplete ? https://old.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/iizw2q/new_zshautocomplete_features_history_menu/
- Remove the stow dependency - Maybe with dotbot? Stow is oftentimes not installed and it's kinda annoying having to install it without sudo
- Yabai focus follows mouse is kinda annoying for stuff like iStat Menus. I think I have a correct rule but the release is still not there yet 2020-11-25 (https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/675) - Check this in the future.
